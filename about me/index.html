			Hi, my name is Cuiying Lin. I was born on November 15, 2018 in Xinhui, Jiangmen, Guangdong. I live in bridgeport.
			I attended to Robert Healy Elementary for elementary and middle school. My first friend is the daughter of my neighbor.
			My hobbies are eating and sleeping. I do not play any sports. School days were sometimes fun, but other times it was torture.
			I am currently taking classes at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School. I do not have any extra-curricular activities.
			My furture plans are blank, I do not know which college or career I want to go to.
