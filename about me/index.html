			Hi, my name is Cuiying Lin. I was born on November 15, 2018 in Xinhui, Jiangmen, Guangdong. I live in bridgeport.
			I attended Robert Healy Elementary for elementary and middle school. My childhood friend is my neighbor.
			My hobbies are eating and sleeping. I do not play any sports. School days are sometimes fun, but other times it is a pain.
			I am currently taking classes at Whitney M. Young Magnet High School. I do not have any extra-curricular activities.
			My furture plans are blank as a sheet of printer paper. I do not know which college I want to go nor career I want.
