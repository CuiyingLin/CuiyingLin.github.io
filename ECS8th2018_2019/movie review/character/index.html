		<h2>Queen Elsa</h2>
		<p>
		Queen Elsa had magical ice powers ever since her birth, her parents fear that such power will harm her and her sister, Anna. They isolated the two playing together. Elsa, too, feared that she will hurt her sister again like she once did, she locked herself inside her room. In the end, Elsa managed to find a way to control her powers and lived happily with Princess Anna and Kristoff.
