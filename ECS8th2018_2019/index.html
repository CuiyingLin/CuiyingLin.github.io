		I learned some HTML/CSS codes from this class such as tags, attributes, and values.
		Some advice for future ECS students is to be careful while typing out codes especially when two imput methods at the same time.
		The symbols are usually different, for example: 
		this is the English keyboard colon ":" and this is the Chinese version of colon "ï¼š".
		As you can see, there is a slight difference between these two symbols, the Chinese keyboard makes this colon bolder than the English keyboard. 
		Another advice is to always check the spellings of your code, one letter difference does matter a lot!
		Also, remember to CLOSE the tags used in the code.
